# YesWeSell

It's a group's project as part of the YesWeWeb formation.  
We had to make a website which is selling shoes and we had to use PHP to display a single page with differents characteristics.  
We used Scrum and Trello for the organization of the project.
This was the first sprint (of one week) out of four, so the project will evolve with the client's needs during the current month.
