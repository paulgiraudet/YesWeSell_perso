# YesWeSell

It's a group's project as part of the YesWeWeb formation.  
We had to make a website which is selling shoes and we had to use PHP to display a single page with differents characteristics.  
We used Scrum and Trello for the organization of the project.

second sprint of one week

adding admin session with the possibility to add a new product if all the fields are correct

have to change the cart incrementation with the use of a cookie or with a globad session var instead of a javascript function cause we can't keep our cart full
